# Explore-US-Bikeshare Readme
Welcome to the Explore-US-Bikeshare project repository! This project focuses on exploring bike share usage patterns in major cities across the United States. By analyzing data from the first six months of 2017, we aim to uncover insights into bike share system usage, compare patterns between Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC, and provide valuable statistics related to travel times, popular stations, and user demographics.

# Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to conduct an in-depth analysis of bike share system usage across three major cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. We leverage randomly selected data from the first half of 2017 to extract meaningful insights and answer key questions about bike share usage patterns. The dataset includes the following core columns for each trip:

Start Time: The start time of the trip.
End Time: The end time of the trip.
Trip Duration: The duration of the trip in seconds.
Start Station: The station where the trip started.
End Station: The station where the trip ended.
User Type: The type of user (Subscriber or Customer).
In addition, the Chicago and New York City datasets include the following columns:

Gender: Gender of the user.
Birth Year: Birth year of the user.


# Project Structure
The repository is organized as follows:

data: This directory contains the raw datasets for the three cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. The datasets include information about bike share trips and user attributes.

notebooks: This directory houses Jupyter Notebook files where the data analysis is performed step by step. Each notebook corresponds to a specific aspect of the analysis, including popular times of travel, popular stations and trips, trip duration, and user information.

README.md: The current file you are reading, providing an overview of the project, its structure, and instructions for replicating the analysis.

# Conclusion
Through this project, we aimed to uncover bike share usage patterns across three major US cities using data from the first half of 2017. By addressing various aspects such as popular travel times, stations, trip durations, and user demographics, we gained insights into how bike share systems are utilized by different types of users in different cities.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook files to delve into the analysis process and findings. If you have any questions or feedback, don't hesitate to reach out.

Happy exploring!
